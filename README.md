- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @youngbirder. You can call me Coco.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in, as my name indicates, birding all over the world. I enjoy seeing different birds and my dream is to visit Papua New Guinea one day for the incredible birds of paradise. During my birding trips, I also like to photograph birds and wildlife. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently based out of Boston, United States but I am from Shanghai, China. I have been in the U.S. since high school.
- ðŸ“« I am also on Instagram, so if you like my website, please visit my Instagram profile @youngbirder_coco
